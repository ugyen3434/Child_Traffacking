<h3>Preventing human trafficking requires a multi-faceted approach, including raising awareness about the signs of trafficking, strengthening laws and enforcement, and offering support to vulnerable groups. Educating communities, especially young people, about the risks of trafficking can help protect them. Governments must implement and enforce stricter laws to punish traffickers, while providing resources like shelter and counseling for survivors. Addressing underlying issues such as poverty, inequality, and lack of education is crucial to reducing vulnerability, and international collaboration is essential to dismantling trafficking networks across borders.</h3>
